            August 25, 2023 - It has been one whole week since I started working on coding this website. I have no plans for the weekend other than spending time at home. I've learned some stuff about building websites. I learned how to make this journal, publish it to github, and finish it! 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            September 1, 2023 - I learned alot about engineering discipline. On Thursday, I did a challenge where I created a sink in tinkercad in under 20 minutes.

            September 7, 2023 - Today, me and my team started working on a prototype for a mechanical machine we're going to build! We are currently learning on how to build a mechanical machine that can bring a needle up and pop a baloon. I am learning how to build a mechanical machine.

            And here is a photo of the Prototype!
            <br>
            See you next week!
        </p>

            September 22, 2023 - Last week, me and my team made our Rube Goldberg course to pop the baloon! The device worked well when we tested it this week!
            <br>

            <br>
            And this week, we tested the course and sucessfully popped the baloon! We also did a few challenges where we made a floatation device (mine sank)
            <br>
            And the other challenge was where we graphed and cut out the letter E using paper! And lastly, I learned about computer engineering! We learned about RAM, STorage, and more! See you next week!

            September 28, 2023 - This week was really fun! This week, I took apart a PC, and i put it back together spectactuarly! Taking apart technology really interests me, as i've done it before! I learned stuff I already learned 2 years ago about computers, so i was pretty advanced at the challenge.

            October 6, 2023 - I learned alot about Biochemistry this week and it seemed really interesting. I saw a 3d printed heart, robotic hands, etc. Also, me and my team this week made a hand out of cardboard and string that could pick up a water bottle. Here's what it looks like:
